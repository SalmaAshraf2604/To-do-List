# To-Do List (HTML & CSS Only)

A simple and clean To-Do List web page built using only HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates basic webpage structure, styling, and layout techniques without any JavaScript.

- A main title and introductory text
- A motivational or task-specific section ("Read a Book")

All content is styled using an external CSS file (`style.css`), with a focus on static design and modern UI components.
